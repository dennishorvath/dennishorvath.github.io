      <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
      <div class="indent">
        <p>I'm a mechanical engineer and have been supporting blood pump development at the 
         Cleveland Clinic for the past 20 years. I have 38 years experience, 34 of which 
         specialized in the design and development of pumping devices. My 14 years of industrial
         background in the aircraft industry between 1981 and 1995 provided me with the intuitive 
         understanding and design skills required to invent and transform research devices into
         practical designs. </p>

      <h2>Contributions to Science</h2>
      <div class="indent">
        <p>I’m the primary inventor of the Cleveland Clinic Continuous Flow Total Artificial Heart (CFTAH), and responsible for its design evolution and refinement. I served as a focal point for all related mechanical design, fabrication assembly and test. Previously, I similarly supported the design evolution of the CorAide LVAD and DexAide RVAD, and refinements to the Nimbus/Cleveland Clinic E4T pulsatile total artificial heart. I’m now continuing with the design of other advanced MCS devices. </p>
