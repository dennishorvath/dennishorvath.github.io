      <h1>About the Virtual Mock Loop</h2>
      <p>The Virtual Mock Loop under development is a numerical simulation of the cardiovascular system, modeling healthy and diseased cases with a variety of different combinations of conditions. The simulation can be fitted with design models of cardiovascular devices for the purpose of design optimization for a range of patient sizes and disease conditions, and the user interface can be customized for education and training purposes.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp</p>
<p>The current system includes a selection of several different performance models of continuous flow left ventricular assist devices (CF-LVADs) having different head curves. The user can specify the speed settings as well as the design point of the LVAD pumps.
      <p>&nbsp</p>
      <p>The program is being developed in the Matlab environment, and simulates the hemodynamics of the cardiovascular system with a lumped parameter model, including systemic and pulmonary circulations, four chambers of the heart and valve characteristics. Inputs include a distribution of impedances, systolic and diastolic compliances, beat rate and blood volume. The output of the system includes the pressure, volume, and flow through each of the major parts of the circulatory system as it varies over several seconds. Refer to the How to Use and Example Cases tabs.
</p>

      <p>An example output screen is shown below, comparing left ventricular and aortic pressure in a healthy case and a case with systolic heart failure.</p>
